# MiniNeuron - Fun Neuron Animation

A colorful, interactive neuron animation built for **coding workflow practice** and visual fun ~~(and wasting time)~~! 

## What's This?

This is a **coding workflow practice project** from one of my older small demos, focusing on:

- SVG animations & DOM manipulation
- JavaScript timing & sequencing
- Interactive UI development
- Visual effects with CSS/JS

**⚠️ Not scientifically accurate** - just fun visuals inspired by biology!

## Features

- **Colorful Action Potentials** - Waves travel along the axon
- **Ion Channel Animations** - Tiny balls moving through channels
- **Synaptic Transmission** - Neurotransmitter release effects

## Tech Stack

- **Pure JavaScript** - No frameworks & main libs
- **SVG Animations** - Smooth vector graphics
- **CSS3 Effects** - Gradients, filters, transforms

---

**Remember:** This is art + code workflow practice, not science! Have fun exploring the visual possibilities.
